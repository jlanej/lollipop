# Fix Summary: Protein Domain and Variant Plotting Issue

## Problem Statement
"No protein domains are being plotted, and no variants are displayed"

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue occurred when `auto_retrieve = TRUE` was enabled but the retrieval process failed (e.g., due to network issues or API errors). The specific problem was in the `create_detailed_lollipop_plot()` function:

1. When `retrieve_protein_data()` threw an error, the tryCatch block caught it
2. However, the `protein_data` variable was never assigned (assignment failed during the error)
3. The code tried to access `protein_data$domains`, `protein_data$ptms`, and `protein_data$protein_length`
4. Since `protein_data` was NULL, `protein_length` remained NULL
5. The validation check failed with a misleading error message
6. The plot was never created, so **both domains AND variants were not displayed**

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Initialize protein_data Before Retrieval
```r
# Initialize protein_data with default empty structure
protein_data <- list(
  domains = data.frame(...),
  ptms = data.frame(...),
  protein_length = NULL
)

tryCatch({
  protein_data <- retrieve_protein_data(gene_name, cache_dir)
}, error = function(e) {
  warning(paste("Failed to auto-retrieve protein data:", e$message))
})
```

This ensures that `protein_data` always has a valid structure, even if retrieval fails.

### 2. Add Null Safety Checks
Changed from:
```r
if (is.null(protein_domains) && nrow(protein_data$domains) > 0)
```

To:
```r
if (is.null(protein_domains) && !is.null(protein_data$domains) && nrow(protein_data$domains) > 0)
```

This prevents errors when accessing fields of potentially null structures.

### 3. Improve Error Messages
Changed from:
```r
stop("protein_length must be provided or auto_retrieve must be enabled")
```

To:
```r
if (auto_retrieve) {
  stop(paste("Could not retrieve protein length for", gene_name, 
             ". Please provide protein_length manually or check network connectivity and gene name."))
} else {
  stop("protein_length must be provided when auto_retrieve is disabled")
}
```

This provides clear, actionable guidance to users.

### 4. Fix Deprecation Warnings
Replaced deprecated `size` parameter with `linewidth` in ggplot2 geom calls to eliminate warnings.

## Files Modified

1. **R/detailed_lollipop_plot.R** - Package version of plotting function
2. **detailed_lollipop_plot.R** - Standalone script version
3. **test_fix_verification.R** - NEW: Comprehensive test suite

## Test Coverage

Created comprehensive test suite with 6 scenarios:

1. ✓ Auto-retrieval with complete data (domains, PTMs, protein_length)
2. ✓ Auto-retrieval with protein_length only (empty domains/PTMs)
3. ✓ Manual protein_length without auto-retrieval
4. ✓ Manual domains, PTMs, and protein_length
5. ✓ Auto-retrieval failure produces clear error message
6. ✓ Empty variant data for gene (no crash)

**All 6 tests passing.**

## Verification

To verify the fix:

```bash
# Run the comprehensive test suite
Rscript test_fix_verification.R

# Expected output: "✓✓✓ ALL TESTS PASSED ✓✓✓"
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- When auto-retrieval failed: **No plot created, no variants displayed**
- Error message was misleading
- Users confused about what went wrong

### After Fix
- When auto-retrieval fails: **Clear error message, suggests manual protein_length**
- When protein_length is provided manually: **Plot created with variants (even without domains/PTMs)**
- When auto-retrieval succeeds: **Full plot with domains, PTMs, and variants**
- No more deprecation warnings

## Backward Compatibility

✓ All existing functionality preserved
✓ Existing successful cases unchanged
✓ New error handling only activates in failure scenarios
✓ Manual data provision still works as before

## Security

- No security vulnerabilities introduced
- No new dependencies added
- Only defensive error handling and improved error messages
- CodeQL: No issues (R not analyzed by CodeQL)

## Summary

The fix ensures that:
1. **Variants are ALWAYS displayed** when valid variant data is provided (regardless of domain/PTM retrieval status)
2. **Domains and PTMs are displayed** when successfully retrieved or manually provided
3. **Clear error messages** guide users when auto-retrieval fails
4. **Graceful degradation** - plots work with minimal data (just protein_length and variants)
