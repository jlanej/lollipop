# Fix for JMJD1C Auto-Retrieval Issue

## Problem Description

When calling `create_detailed_lollipop_plot()` with `auto_retrieve = TRUE` for the gene JMJD1C, the function would fail with the error:

```
Error in create_detailed_lollipop_plot(variant_data = combined_report,  : 
  protein_length must be provided or auto_retrieve must be enabled
```

Even though auto-retrieval was enabled and the function successfully retrieved protein information from UniProt (as evidenced by the messages printed), the protein_length was not being set, causing the validation check to fail.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `retrieve_protein_data()` function in `R/data_retrieval.R` and `data_retrieval.R`. 

The function would:
1. Successfully fetch protein information from UniProt
2. Print messages showing it found the accession and protein length
3. Call `extract_domains()` to extract domain information
4. If `extract_domains()` threw an error (e.g., because the features data structure wasn't in the expected format), the entire function would fail
5. Since the function failed, it would not return the `protein_length`, even though it had been successfully retrieved

The same issue could occur with `extract_ptms()`.

## The Fix

We added two layers of error handling:

### 1. Data Frame Validation in extract_domains() and extract_ptms()

Added checks to ensure the `features` field from UniProt is a data frame before attempting to filter it:

```r
# Ensure features is a data frame or can be treated as one
if (!is.data.frame(features)) {
  if (length(features) == 0) {
    return(data.frame(...))  # Return empty data frame
  }
  # If features is not a data frame, log and return empty
  warning("Features is not a data frame, cannot extract domains")
  return(data.frame(...))  # Return empty data frame
}
```

This prevents errors when the UniProt API returns features in an unexpected format.

### 2. Error Handling in retrieve_protein_data()

Wrapped the calls to `extract_domains()` and `extract_ptms()` in `tryCatch` blocks:

```r
# Extract domains and PTMs with error handling
domains <- tryCatch({
  d <- extract_domains(protein_info, gene_symbol)
  message(paste("  Found", nrow(d), "domains"))
  d
}, error = function(e) {
  warning(paste("Failed to extract domains:", e$message))
  data.frame(...)  # Return empty data frame on error
})

ptms <- tryCatch({
  p <- extract_ptms(protein_info, gene_symbol)
  message(paste("  Found", nrow(p), "PTMs"))
  p
}, error = function(e) {
  warning(paste("Failed to extract PTMs:", e$message))
  data.frame(...)  # Return empty data frame on error
})
```

This ensures that even if domain or PTM extraction fails, the function will still return the protein_length, which is the minimum required information for creating a lollipop plot.

## Result

After the fix:
- The function will successfully retrieve and return `protein_length` even if domain/PTM extraction fails
- Users will see warning messages if domain/PTM extraction fails, making the issue visible
- The plot can still be created with just the protein_length, even without domain and PTM annotations
- The fix is backward compatible - genes where domain/PTM extraction works will continue to work as before

## Testing

Three test files were created to verify the fix:
- `test_problem_scenario.R` - Reproduces the exact scenario from the problem statement
- `test_jmjd1c_fix.R` - Tests the full workflow with JMJD1C
- `test_unit_data_retrieval.R` - Unit tests for the data retrieval function

These tests can be run with R to verify the fix works as expected.
